## What is aRSS?

**aRSS.app** (a Really Simple Syndication app) is a _Progressive Web App_ (PWA) like Google Reader with a timeline UI akin to social media.

It's easy to remember with a bit of cheeky word-play (pronounced "_arse app_") and an attempt to make it easier to decentralise your social circle's content with no surveillance capitalism or anti-social algorithms trying to influence your experience.

It's inspired by [Aral Balkin](https://twitter.com/aral)’s [blog to revive Really Simple Syndication (RSS)](https://ar.al/2018/06/29/reclaiming-rss/) and follows up on some similar thoughts by [Si](https://twitter.com/Si) from earlier in the year (_TODO: find tweet_).

It's an open-source project, built by a community of people who will be using it. 

It's an opportunity to utilise the latest Web tech stacks (e.g. React, Node, Kubernetes…) into a mobile/touch friendly experience that's also optimised for desktops as well.
