## What is aRSS?

**aRSS.app** (a Really Simple Syndication app) is a _Progressive Web App_ (PWA) like Google Reader with a timeline UI akin to social media.

It's easy to remember with a bit of cheeky word-play (pronounced "_arse app_") and an attempt to make it easier to decentralise your social circle's content with no surveillance capitalism or anti-social algorithms trying to influence your experience.

It's inspired by [Aral Balkin](https://twitter.com/aral)‚Äôs [blog to revive Really Simple Syndication (RSS)](https://ar.al/2018/06/29/reclaiming-rss/) and follows up on some similar thoughts by [Si](https://twitter.com/Si) from earlier in the year (_TODO: find tweet_).

It's an open-source project, built by a community of people who will be using it. 

It's an opportunity to utilise the latest Web tech stacks (e.g. React, Node, Kubernetes‚Ä¶) into a mobile/touch friendly experience that's also optimised for desktops as well.

## Ideas

* Register ARSS.APP domain (~¬£11.23/yr from Namecheap.com)
* Subscribe to your contacts‚Äô websites and blogs
* Use existing social circles (Twitter) to find content sources (e.g. scrape your Twitter following/followers)
* Comment directly on post **if possible**.
* Filter content by 
	* Tags
	* Categories
	* Personal
* Post directly from aRSS with secure authentication
	* Encourage micro posts with oEmbed
	* Link to external content (e.g. YouTube, Soundcloud, Github‚Ä¶)
	* Attach media directly (photos, audio, video)
	* Configure default categories, taxonomy
	* Location awareness?
* Share / repost directly to your own site
* Create account with wordpress.com for entry level
* Other CMS available e.g. Hugo - _TODO: investigate!_

## Questions

* Is it social if you can't interact? 
* You can reshare but how do you respond? 
* How do you decentralise comments?
* Encourage enabling blog comments but what are there tools to limit spam, hate, trolls? e.g. Facebook and Instagram Machine Learning mechanisms (replacing comments with snakes üêç), Microsoft's machine learning algorithm
